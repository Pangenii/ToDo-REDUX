# **React + Redux Learning Notes**

---
This readme contains my notes and understanding of Redux fundamentals.
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

It has two related libraries:
**React-DOM** → Used for building web applications

**React-Native** → Used for building mobile applications

## **Redux Basics**

Redux is an independent state management tool.
It can be used with:

- React

- Vanilla JavaScript

- Angular

- Other JS frameworks

## **Core Concepts of Redux**
1. ### **Store**
   -Acts as a global state container.
   -Holds the entire application state.
2. ### **Reducers**
   -All state changes must go through reducers.
   -Functions that update the store.
3. ### **useSelector**
   -Used to select/access data from the store inside React components.
4. ### **useDispatch**
   -Used to dispatch actions (add, remove, update).
